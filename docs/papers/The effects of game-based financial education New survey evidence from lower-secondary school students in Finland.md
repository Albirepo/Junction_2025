## Abstract {property="name"}

::: {role="paragraph"}
The authors of this article studied the effects of game-based financial
education approaches using a sample of lower-secondary school students
in Finland. The sample consisted of 640 students from 42 schools in
different areas of the country. The authors focused on three different
game-based interventions using a pre- and post-intervention survey
design. They compared the effects of the interventions (and their
combinations) to a control group that received only traditional
teaching. They found robust effects with respect to knowledge gained
from game-based approaches. However, the effects on self-reported
financial behaviors were weak.

There has been a considerable debate on the effectiveness of financial
education in general. Doubts have been raised on 1) whether financial
education influences financial behavior and 2) whether financial
education even influences financial knowledge (e.g., Fernandes, Lynch,
and Netemeyer [2014](#index.xhtml#CIT0012){.biblioref
role="doc-biblioref" xml-rid="CIT0012"}; Frisancho
[2020](#index.xhtml#CIT0013){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"

xml-rid="CIT0035"}; Willis [2008](#index.xhtml#CIT0037){.biblioref
role="doc-biblioref" xml-rid="CIT0037"}). Kaiser and Menkhoff
([2017](#index.xhtml#CIT0018){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0018"}) summarized the recent research in their
meta-analysis, where they found robust evidence of financial education
impacting financial knowledge. They also found support for the
proposition that financial education influenced behavior, although the
effects were small and often focused on certain types of behaviors.
These results were also supported by further analysis in Kaiser et al.
([In press](#index.xhtml#CIT0017){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0017"}).
:::

::: {role="paragraph"}
According to Amagir et al. ([2018](#index.xhtml#CIT0003){.biblioref
role="doc-biblioref" xml-rid="CIT0003"}), typical ways in which
increases in financial literacy are assessed in a school context are 1)
increases in knowledge, 2) changes in (self-reported) financial
behavior, and 3) changes in attitudes. In assessing knowledge gains,
studies in the secondary school context typically find improvements
after educational interventions. The majority of studies also report
changes in attitudes, whereas findings relating to behavioral changes
are scarce. In a recent article, Kaiser and Menkhoff
([2020](#index.xhtml#CIT0020){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0020"}) included even more recent studies but limited their
focus on financial education in schools (primary, middle, and high
schools). They found very similar results to those in their previous
meta-analysis in which all types of financial education produced
relatively large effects on financial knowledge but small (although
still significant) effects on behavior. Both Amagir et al.
([2018](#index.xhtml#CIT0003){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0003"}) and Kaiser and Menkhoff
([2020](#index.xhtml#CIT0020){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0020"}) speculated that the small effects related to
behavior might be linked to the fact that schoolchildren rarely make any
important economic decisions independently.
:::

::: {role="paragraph"}
While the focus of discussions initially has been largely on whether
financial education has an impact, the discussion is gradually moving to
the question of what actually works in financial education. Such studies
include Drexler, Fischer, and Schoar
([2014](#index.xhtml#CIT0011){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0011"}), who study rules of thumb vs. principles-based
approaches; Lusardi et al. ([2017](#index.xhtml#CIT0028){.biblioref
role="doc-biblioref" xml-rid="CIT0028"}), who investigated the use of
visual tools and narratives in financial education; Kaiser and Menkhoff
([2018](#index.xhtml#CIT0019){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0019"}), who found that active learning approaches worked
better than traditional lectures in a sample of entrepreneurs; and
Carpena et al. ([2019](#index.xhtml#CIT0008){.biblioref
role="doc-biblioref" xml-rid="CIT0008"}), who studied the effects of
personalized counseling and goal-setting. However, none of these studies
took place in a school setting. In contrast, the recent article by
Iterbeke et al. ([2020](#index.xhtml#CIT0016){.biblioref
role="doc-biblioref" xml-rid="CIT0016"}) studied, in a secondary school
setting, the impact of ability matching and differentiated education in
financial education.
:::

::: {role="paragraph"}
However, the use of games in financial education has remained an
understudied issue. Nevertheless, there is a perception, especially
among practitioners, that games can be an important tool in teaching and
learning financial literacy (e.g., Maynard et al.
[2012](#index.xhtml#CIT0030){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0030"}). In the broader field of economic education, and
especially in research concerning higher education, the potential of
using games and simulations has been recognized for quite some time.[^1]
:::

::: {role="paragraph"}
There has been an increased interest in game-based approaches in Finnish
schools to increase the effectiveness of financial education.
Appropriately for that context, the aim of this study is to evaluate the
effects of game-based approaches on financial literacy compared to the
situation where there are only traditional teaching methods. Therefore,
we do not compare the effects of a stand-alone intervention vs. no
intervention but rather, the effects of the delivery mode (game-based
vs. traditional) and their influences on financial literacy. The methods
that we investigate relate to the paradigm of active or experiential
learning, which has been regarded as having promise in economic
education (Amagir et al. [2018](#index.xhtml#CIT0003){.biblioref
role="doc-biblioref" xml-rid="CIT0003"}; Collins and Odders-White
[2015](#index.xhtml#CIT0009){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0009"}).

## Background

::: {#index.xhtml#sec-1-1 .section}
### Financial literacy teaching in Finnish schools

::: {role="paragraph"}
The Finnish educational system has received considerable positive
attention related to achievements in the Programme for International
Student Assessment (PISA) rankings since the early 2000s. More recently,
the performance of Finland in the PISA has somewhat declined. As a
response, there has been an increased emphasis on phenomenon-based
learning and digitalization in teaching in the new curriculum plan for
primary and secondary schools (Lonka et al.
[2018](#index.xhtml#CIT0025){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0025"}). Finland also ranked highly in the PISA for
financial literacy in 2018, in second place out of 20 countries
(Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development \[OECD\]
[2020](#index.xhtml#CIT0031){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0031"}).
:::

::: {role="paragraph"}
Economic and financial literacy can be regarded as examples of
cross-disciplinary themes. Financial literacy is not taught as a
separate subject. It is part of a module in "economic knowledge," which
in turn is part of the social studies curriculum. The learning goals of
the module include elements both in personal financial management and in
a broader macroeconomic context. Economic issues are taught in diverse
fields of study, such as study counseling, home economics, and
mathematics. Teaching typically takes place within social studies, where
teachers mostly specialize in history and not economics. One outcome of
this is that teachers actually are not very well informed in economic
analysis. Moreover, the material in the school textbooks does not always
adequately cover the voluntary K--12 content standards by the Council of
Economic Analysis (Siegfried et al.
[2010](#index.xhtml#CIT0032){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0032"}), although they are partly covered in the Finnish
curriculum (Kalmi, Maliranta, and Alanko
[2019](#index.xhtml#CIT0023){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0023"}).
:::

::: {role="paragraph"}
The ninth year of mandatory schooling in Finland contains an economics
curriculum that combines the subjects of financial literacy, which is
understood to be personal financial management skills applicable at the
level of individuals and households, and economic literacy (Hansen,
Salemi, and Siegfried [2002](#index.xhtml#CIT0015){.biblioref
role="doc-biblioref" xml-rid="CIT0015"}; Walstad and Soper
[1988](#index.xhtml#CIT0036){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0036"}), which is related to the application of key economic
principles to economic analyses in various issues that are beyond
personal financial management; for instance, issues related to informed
voting behavior in economic policy contexts. According to the national
curriculum for grades 7 through 9, after having the economic knowledge
module within social studies, the students should be able to apply
economic knowledge in the domains of personal financial management,
entrepreneurship and informed career choice, planning for the future,
and democratic participation. The curriculum also includes certain
attitudinal elements, such as applying ethical thinking in economic
choice. However, these normative and attitudinal issues are not graded.

### Programs of game-based learning

::: {role="paragraph"}
We focused on three distinct game-based programs. The programs have
rather different foci, as two of them are geared toward personal
financial management and one is a business game. We summarize the
characteristics of these games in [table 1](t0001.xhtml).

::: {role="paragraph"}
Yrityskylä is a business game in a physical learning environment. It is
operated through the Economic Information Office (EIO), which is owned
by the Confederation of Finnish Industries. Since 2010, EIO has also run
a similarly named educational program, Yrityskylä, for primary school
students, which is well known in Finland (Kalmi
[2018b](#index.xhtml#CIT0022){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0022"}). The program for the secondary school is more
recent, with the pilot phase having started in 2016. Nevertheless, it
has spread quite rapidly, and the aim is to increase its scope to a
national level in a few years.
:::

::: {role="paragraph"}
In the game, students represent a business organization and have several
choices. For instance, they can make purchase decisions, try to optimize
production processes, apply for loans, make investment decisions, and
sell their products, all in a simulated environment. The skills that are
required in the game include knowledge about some basic accounting
decisions, mathematics, human interaction, and foreign language skills
(as some sales pitches are made in English).[^2] Students play this game
in a designated physical environment using digital tools (tablets). They
work in teams of five students, which allows for some functional
specialization according to student capabilities. A visit to the
physical learning environment is preceded by some general lessons on
business management and on other decision skills that are required for
gameplay. While the topic of the game is not personal finance, the
learning goals are related, e.g., to work-life skills and budgeting, so
it is quite possible that there is spillover to personal finance
domains. Altogether, according to teachers, this game took 5 to 8 hours,
including the visit to the physical learning environment that took
several hours. Therefore, timewise, this is the most extensive of all
the studied programs.
:::

::: {role="paragraph"}
Oma Onni is a Web-based learning environment in which the material is
produced by students in a vocational school (see Kalmi
[2018a](#index.xhtml#CIT0021){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0021"}). It is sponsored by foundations that own Oma
Säästöpankki, a bank with roots in local savings banks. It is produced
by the SEDU vocational school in Seinäjoki, Western Finland. It has been
in operation since 2010, and its learning contents have been
continuously updated.
:::

::: {role="paragraph"}
The material in Oma Onni includes games, quizzes, videos, and other
interactive material. Most of the learning for secondary school students
takes place over the Internet. The students typically go through this
material individually in the classroom. Additionally, students from the
vocational institute may also visit lower-secondary schools. In addition
to being Web-based, another feature of the program is that it represents
a form of peer learning, as the lower-secondary school students learn
from vocational school students, who are only a few years older. The
focus of the program is clearly on personal financial management. The
learning goals of the program relate to work-life skills, knowledge that
is relevant in managing personal finance, and financial attitudes
oriented toward prudence and forward planning. Teachers reported that
the use of the learning environment took approximately 4 to 6 hours.[^3]
:::

::: {role="paragraph"}
Money Flow Challenge is a mobile game with five different levels. It is
designed by a small personal finance consulting firm called Planago. The
game includes topics such as consumption, savings, investment, and
mortgage decisions. Students learn to make rational, utility-based
decisions concerning personal financial management. This particular
learning environment does not require much infrastructure compared to
the other two environments and mainly requires a mobile device that can
be used for playing the game. Students played this during lectures.
There was also a short tutorial. Ideally, it would also include a
feedback discussion, although that apparently did not take place in all
schools. The hours used for the study of this game were lower than in
the two other cases. Students were usually exposed to the Money Flow
Challenge over two hours of classes. Money Flow Challenge is also the
most recent of the programs, having started in 2014.
:::

::: {role="paragraph"}
Game-based teaching is regularly used in many disciplines in Finnish
schools. Within economics, one limiting factor has surely been the lack
of easy access to relevant games. There are some exceptions, like the
monetary policy games developed by the European Central Bank and some
games launched by the Finnish branch of Junior Achievement. These games
differ from the above-mentioned programs because they are relatively
short and easy to use, usually taking up only a fraction of the class
hour. According to our teacher survey, the use of other games was
somewhat more common in the control group than in the treatment group.
In our empirical approach, we test whether this difference affects our
results.

## Study design and methods

::: {#index.xhtml#sec-2-1 .section}
### Allocation of programs

::: {role="paragraph"}
In our study, we focus on the development of the economic capabilities
of 9th-grade students, who have a mandatory module of economics. The
focus of the study is on whether game-based approaches result in better
learning achievement than in the absence of gamified teaching. The
classes are divided into an intervention group, where the classes
participate in game-based teaching, and a control group that does not
participate in the interventions. In this approach, it is notable that
there exists considerable heterogeneity due to the different teaching
styles of social science educators. Some teachers may well use games in
their teaching even if part of the control group. Within the
intervention group, the vigor at which teachers incorporate game-based
approaches in their teaching is likely to differ among teachers. It is
also possible that many teachers in the control group are likely to use
active learning approaches, whereas the teaching of many teachers in the
intervention group may be more traditional. To control for this, we
asked the teachers about the teaching methods they use.
:::

::: {role="paragraph"}
The ways in which the programs were allocated to different schools
differed somewhat among programs. Yrityskylä and Oma Onni were allocated
with direct agreements between the program providers and municipal
school authorities. Yrityskylä aims to be a nationwide provider of
financial education and is widely used in different municipalities, even
though the program for secondary schools is relatively new and not
offered in all parts of the country. Oma Onni is in turn tied to the
operating area of the savings bank behind the program. In neither of
these cases could the researchers affect the allocation of the programs,
as the allocation depends on the geographical location of
municipalities. In contrast, it was possible to randomize the use of the
Money Flow Challenge. A constraint was that we did not want to offer it
to schools that already had two interventions to prevent an overload of
economic education programs in our groups. Thus, we randomly offered the
Money Flow Challenge to 14 schools in the group of schools that either
did not participate in the other two interventions or participated in
only one of the other interventions. In the end, approximately one-half
of the subjects to whom it was offered took it.
:::

::: {role="paragraph"}
In summary, because of the practical constraints posed by the
arrangements of the programs, even the intention to treat is not
randomly allocated (except for the Money Flow Challenge intervention).
The intention to treat is determined by external factors such as the
availability of the programs that may or may not be related to student
characteristics. However, because it is determined at the municipality
level and not, e.g., by individual teachers, we have no strong reasons
to believe the intervention and control samples differ in their
unobservable characteristics.
:::

::: {role="paragraph"}
We selected 12 towns for our work, with the idea that we would find a
reasonable representation of schools with and without programs.
Initially, approximately 60 schools from 12 different towns agreed to
participate in the study, but some of them dropped out before the start
of the year or during the year. Furthermore, because parental consent
letters were required, the number of students was limited to 982 of over
3700 students who took the pre-intervention survey. Due to school,
class, or student attrition, the final sample size was further limited
to 640 students who also took the post-intervention survey. Thus, in the
final data, we analyzed pupils from 42 schools in 11 towns. A total of
433 of the responding students received game-based teaching along with
typical economics education; an additional 44 students should have
received the treatment but did not, while 163 did not receive treatment
and formed our control group.[^4] Some students participated in two
game-based interventions, while others participated in only one
intervention. [Table 2](t0002.xhtml) presents the final data for the
number of students in different groups.

### Survey data and questionnaire

::: {role="paragraph"}
We conducted pre- and post-intervention surveys on economic knowledge,
savings behavior, planning ahead, and impulse shopping among ninth year
students. The survey was based partly on a previous questionnaire used
in the Oma Onni program in analyzing student learning (Kalmi
[2018a](#index.xhtml#CIT0021){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0021"}). However, the Oma Onni program focuses solely on
personal finance, whereas some programs included in our study, as well
as the learning goals of the Finnish curriculum, are broader, including
issues of "economic literacy" (for instance, firms, macroeconomics, and
economic policy). Therefore, we broadened these questions so that
one-half of the knowledge questions covered questions related to
personal finance, and the other half of the questions concerned firms
and macroeconomics.[^5] Moreover, the questionnaire was divided into
knowledge questions[^6] and into questions dealing with behavior and
attitudes. The question sets in the two surveys were identical regarding
financial behavior, but the financial knowledge questions were
different. The two surveys and their questions were pretested with
vocational education students.
:::

::: {role="paragraph"}
The first survey was conducted in autumn 2017 with the assumption that
no economics education took place before the survey. The second survey
took place in spring 2018 after the educational interventions and other
economics teaching in the curriculum. However, some classes had already
started economics education before they took the first survey, while
some classes had their final lessons in economics only after the second
survey was taken. Therefore, we obtained the teaching schedules and
controlled for these differences in our empirical setting.
:::

::: {role="paragraph"}
We also conducted a survey among the parents in which we asked for
background information, such as parental education, and tested for
parents' own financial knowledge with the "three big" questions of
financial literacy (Lusardi and Mitchell
[2014](#index.xhtml#CIT0027){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0027"}). The additional parental survey was voluntary. We
had a response rate of 76 percent of those who also gave a research
permit.
:::

::: {role="paragraph"}
Our pre- and post-intervention surveys contained questions on financial
knowledge and attitudes and behavior, as well as students' background
characteristics. [Table 3](t0003.xhtml) presents definitions and
measurements of the variables used in the empirical analysis.[^7] Our
main outcome variable is the standardized test score, which measures the
student's financial knowledge. The test scores were demeaned so that
they had a mean of zero and a standard error of one.

Because some of the schools and classes dropped out between the first
and second survey and parental consent was required, our final sample
was shaped by a two-stage selection process and, thus, may not present
the initial target group of the study. Furthermore, some parents
selected not to respond to the parental survey. [Table 4](t0004.xhtml)
analyzes these attrition processes by showing students' initial level of
financial knowledge according to the group.

[Table 4](t0004.xhtml) shows that students in the treatment group
performed slightly better in the pre-intervention survey. The table
further illustrates that those students who also returned the second
survey performed significantly better in the pre-intervention survey,
which may reflect unobservable school or teacher characteristics. This
selection process appears in both the treatment and the control groups.
However, a smaller proportion of students in the control group answered
the post-intervention survey than in the treatment group, and the
attrited students in the control group appear to differ from
non-attrited students somewhat more than in the treated group. We find
no statistically significant differences in the financial knowledge
between the treatment and control groups for students who took both
surveys. Students for whom we obtained parental consent also performed
significantly better in the pre-intervention survey. Receiving a
response to the parental survey also appears to correlate with students'
higher financial knowledge. The plausible reason for this is that
answering the parental survey correlates with the student's
socioeconomic background. Parents who take a more active interest in
their children's school performance can be both more likely to respond
to parental surveys and support their children to attain higher levels
of academic performance. However, we do not believe that these selection
processes endanger our treatment effect estimation because these
processes appear in both groups. As attrition is more common in the
control group, we explore the predictors of attrition and use inverse
probability weighting in our regressions to take selected attrition into
account. Finally, it should be noted that our final sample includes
students with a higher initial level of financial knowledge than the
whole population of 9^th^-graders, which may limit how far we can
generalize our results.[^8]
:::

::: {role="paragraph"}
[Table 5](t0005.xhtml) presents summary statistics for the treatment and
control groups based on the first survey before any intervention had
taken place. The initial level of financial knowledge does not
statistically differ significantly between the two groups. The groups
are also similar with respect to variables reflecting family background.
However, the groups differ with respect to some observable background
characteristics, e.g., compared with the treatment group, the control
group had more Swedish-speaking students, lower average math grades, and
the teaching of economics had already started in more classes. There are
also some initial differences in students' attitudes toward saving and
personal finance. These are observable characteristics that we can
control in our empirical setting.

### Estimation methods

::: {role="paragraph"}
Next, we specify a regression model to investigate the effect of
game-based economics education on financial knowledge and behavior. As
we explained before, the programs were not randomly placed in
municipalities, so a difference-in-differences estimation strategy is
appropriate. We compare the change in outcome between the first and
second surveys across treatment and control groups while controlling for
students' and classes' background characteristics. The basic
specification is the following:

::: {#index.xhtml#M0001 .display-formula}
::: {.equation role="math"}
::: inner
$$y_{i,t} = \alpha + \beta\mathit{Interventio}n_{i} + \gamma\mathit{Pos}t_{t}^{} + \delta\left( {\mathit{Intervention}*\mathit{Post}} \right)_{it} + \phi\mathit{Control}s_{it} + \varepsilon_{it},$$
:::
:::

::: label
\(1\)
:::
:::

where *y* refers to the outcome variable, which is either the level of
financial knowledge or selected financial behavior outcome. The
*Intervention* variable indicates whether student *i* is in the
treatment or control group. In some of the specifications, we divide the
treatment group further, depending on whether the student participated
in one or two interventions. We also estimate the disaggregate results
for each of the three interventions. The *Post* variable is a time
variable for the separation between the pre-survey and post-survey. Our
main interest is in the interaction of the *Intervention* and *Post*
variables, which reveals the treatment effect of the game-based
education interventions. Control variables include background variables
related to student, class, and family characteristics. Prior studies
have observed that students' numeracy and cognitive skills, as well as
socioeconomic background, are related to financial knowledge and
behavior (e.g., Frisancho [2020](#index.xhtml#CIT0013){.biblioref
role="doc-biblioref" xml-rid="CIT0013"}; Lührmann, Serra-Garcia, and
Winter [2015](#index.xhtml#CIT0026){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0026"}); thus, we control for these characteristics. These
include gender, mother tongue, math grade, and average grade, having a
bank account, and receiving pocket money. We also include as family
background characteristics the number of books at home, whether the
student talks about money with parents, and parental financial literacy.
The control variables are measured in the first survey to avoid any
influence from the interventions on the control variables.
:::

::: {role="paragraph"}
The difference-in-differences estimation rests on the assumption that,
absent intervention for both treatment and control groups, students will
have similar development in their financial knowledge. All students
follow the same curriculum in Finnish schools and, thus, the parallel
trend assumption should hold. However, some of the classes had already
started their economics education prior to the first survey, and some
classes finished their economics lessons only after the second survey.
These differences may cause the parallel trends assumption to not hold.
However, for most classes, we have this information available, and we
can thus add a control variable as well as a time interaction variable
to allow for different time trends with those particular students.
Therefore, observations where this information is not available are
dropped in some of the regressions.
:::

::: {role="paragraph"}
We identify the classes and students who, according to a preassignment,
should have received the treatment. However, some classes did not follow
through with the game-based interventions. For example, the Money Flow
Challenge game was randomly offered to schools, but some teachers
self-selected not to use it in their teaching. Participation in
Yrityskylä was preassigned at the municipality level; however, some
schools or classes did not participate, e.g., due to scheduling reasons.
Thus, our empirical analysis estimates the average effect of intention
to treat (ITT). We can also identify students who actually participated
and received the treatment; i.e., we could estimate the average
treatment effect on treated (ATT). If treatment participation reflects
teachers' self-selection, participation can be correlated with the
knowledge and behavioral outcomes that we study. Therefore, ATT results
can be biased, but ITT results provide an unbiased picture.
:::

::: {role="paragraph"}
However, as Ding and Lehrer ([2010](#index.xhtml#CIT0010){.biblioref
role="doc-biblioref" xml-rid="CIT0010"}) discuss, selective attrition of
students may bias even ITT estimates. Following their approach, we thus
use inverse probability-weighted regressions to correct for potentially
selective attrition. First, let's define L*~t~*~+1~ = 1 to indicate
students who did not answer the post-intervention survey and L*~t~*~+1~
= 0 to indicate non-attrited students. Then, we may model the attrition
process as follows:

::: {#index.xhtml#M0002 .display-formula}
::: {.equation role="math"}
::: inner
$$L_{t + 1,i} = 1\text{~~~}\text{if}~~L_{t + 1,i}^{*} = \alpha\mathit{Control}s_{i} + u_{i}>0~~\text{and}~\text{zero}~\text{otherwise}$$
:::
:::

::: label
\(2\)
:::
:::

where [$L_{t + 1,i}^{*}$]{#index.xhtml#ilm0001 role="math"} is a latent
variable, *Controls* indicate variables from the pre-intervention survey
that predict student attrition, and *u* is an error term. We estimate
this equation with a probit model and then calculate the probability of
each student's non-attrition, i.e., Pr(L*~t~*~+1,I~ = 0) given the
pre-intervention survey information. We then use the inverse of this
predicted probability to weight the observations used to estimate
[equation 1](#index.xhtml#M0001).
:::

::: {role="paragraph"}
In our data, the attrition may happen at the school, class, or student
level. Of 982 students who answered the pre-intervention survey
altogether, 342 did not answer the second survey. Of these students, 200
did not answer the second survey either because their school or class
dropped out. One hundred forty-two students did not answer, even though
some of their classmates did. Thus, it appears that school, class, or
teacher characteristics are more important determinants of attrition
than individual student characteristics.
:::

::: {role="paragraph"}
This was confirmed when we analyzed which factors explained the
attrition. Treatment group status, the language of the school, and
whether teaching had started were the most significant drivers of
student attrition. Lower pre-survey financial knowledge predicted the
attrition in some regressions, but its effect varied depending on
whether other controls were included. Other characteristics of the
students did not explain the probability of attrition. Thus, we chose to
use treatment status, language, and pre-intervention survey financial
knowledge to calculate the probability of attrition. As teaching
schedules and parental financial knowledge are used as controls in some
regressions, we also use these variables to calculate the inverse
probabilities for those ITT estimations, where these variables are used.
Furthermore, when we separate between the intervention programs or one
vs. two interventions in [equation 1](#index.xhtml#M0001), we use these
same treatment indicators to explain attrition. The results for the
probit models explaining the attrition are available upon request.
:::

::: {role="paragraph"}
As a robustness test to account for student dissimilarity between the
intervention and control group, we also use propensity score matching
and difference-in-differences estimation. However, because the theory
developed by Abadie and Imbens ([2006](#index.xhtml#CIT0001){.biblioref
role="doc-biblioref" xml-rid="CIT0001"},
[2016](#index.xhtml#CIT0002){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0002"}) has not been extended to handle multivalued
treatments, we cannot use matching techniques in our main analysis to
compare one vs. two interventions or the effects of the three different
programs. Therefore, we only use matching as a robustness test for the
case of any treatment vs. no treatment.

### Financial knowledge

::: {role="paragraph"}
[Table 6](t0006.xhtml) presents the estimation results from
difference-in-differences estimations using inverse probability
weighting to explain students' financial knowledge.[^9] First, we
analyze students' overall performance on the financial knowledge
questions and add more control variables in the second specification. In
specifications 3 and 4, we separate whether students participated in one
or two interventions. Then, we separately analyze how their knowledge
developed in the two subfields of our survey: personal finance
(specifications 5 and 6) and firms and macroeconomics (specifications 7
and 8). In [table 6](t0006.xhtml), we present only the estimates for the
main variables of interest. All the control variables are measured at
the time of the first survey, and thus, control variables related to
financial behavior have not been influenced by the potential
treatment.[^10]

::: {role="paragraph"}
From [table 6](t0006.xhtml), we can observe that after controlling for
student background, the treatment group performs somewhat worse than the
control group in the pre-survey. However, the treatment effect estimate
is positive and significant, suggesting that the treatment group caught
up and performed better than the control group in the second survey. The
average treatment effect suggests an improvement in financial knowledge
by 0.342 standard deviation in the intervention group. The size of
improvement is in line with the effects reported by Kaiser and Menkhoff
([2020](#index.xhtml#CIT0020){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0020"}) for financial literacy interventions in general.
:::

::: {role="paragraph"}
In specification 2, we also consider that the teaching started and
finished at different times in different classes and also control for
parent's financial literacy. Classes where teaching had already started
performed significantly better in the first survey and subsequently
improved their scores less in the second survey (results available from
the authors). Including these controls increases the main coefficient of
interest (*Intervention \* Post*) slightly.
:::

::: {role="paragraph"}
Based on previous literature, we also expected that parental education
would be an important control variable explaining student performance.
However, in our results, this is not the case; thus, in the end, we did
not include parental education among the control variables. We suspect
that the lack of explanatory power may be because obtaining parental
consent and answers in the parental survey already correlate with the
family's socioeconomic background; thus, parental education does not
contain additional explanatory power.
:::

::: {role="paragraph"}
In specifications 3 and 4, we separately studied the treatment effect of
one game-based intervention and that of two game-based interventions.
The estimate of one intervention is positive, and the estimate of two
interventions is higher and more strongly significant. We also tested
whether these effects are of equal size. The *F*-test *p*-values are
reported at the bottom of [table 6](t0006.xhtml). However, the null
hypothesis of equal ITT effects cannot be rejected.
:::

::: {role="paragraph"}
In specifications 5 through 8, we studied whether the interventions
impact personal finance and macroeconomic and firm-related knowledge
differently. Overall, we observe that the interventions significantly
improve students' knowledge in both subfields and that the treatment
effect estimates are similar in both cases.
:::

::: {role="paragraph"}
In [table 7](t0007.xhtml), we analyzed the three interventions
separately. In our specifications, we did not allow for complementarity
or substitutability between the interventions because, otherwise, the
number of interaction terms would grow excessively. From [table
7](t0007.xhtml), it is apparent that the initial level of financial
knowledge varies by the intervention group, most notably for the group
that was assigned to use Money Flow Challenge (MFC). This is surprising,
considering that this is the only group where the treatment assignment
was randomized.

Turning to treatment effect estimates, we notice that the treatment
effect of the Yrityskylä game is positive and strongly significant. The
estimates are similar to those in [table 6](t0006.xhtml). The treatment
effect of Oma Onni is positive and significant at the 10 percent level
in some specifications, but not when we include a full list of control
variables in the estimation. Finally, the treatment effect of the Money
Flow Challenge is not significant in any of our model specifications,
although the point estimate is often of similar size to Oma Onni.
Moreover, the *F*-test *p*-values at the bottom of [table
7](t0007.xhtml) show that the null hypothesis of equality of these three
ITT estimates can be rejected only for personal finance-related
questions.
:::

::: {role="paragraph"}
The differences in the knowledge gains between the interventions are
consistent with the amount of time used in the interventions (see also
[table 1](t0001.xhtml)). For instance, the students used the most time
for Yrityskylä and the least time for Money Flow Challenge. Yrityskylä
also has the biggest resources by far for pedagogical development and
implementation of all these programs, which also might be reflected in
its results. However, as Yrityskylä focused more on business life and
work-life skills, it is somewhat surprising that its effects are even
stronger on personal finance-related knowledge. This can perhaps be
interpreted as transfer learning: for a successful program, the learning
effects can spill over from one domain to another related domain
(Kneppers et al. [2007](#index.xhtml#CIT0024){.biblioref
role="doc-biblioref" xml-rid="CIT0024"}). For the other two programs, we
do not observe clear differences between personal finance and
macroeconomic questions.

### Financial behavior and attitudes

::: {role="paragraph"}
Students' level of financial knowledge correlates significantly with
most aspects of self-reported financial behavior (correlations available
from the authors). However, when we analyze whether the education
intervention altered students' financial behavior, we observe that the
treatment effects are negligible and statistically insignificant, with
only a few exceptions. [Table 8](t0008.xhtml) presents the estimation
results from difference-in-differences estimations regarding the
behavioral variables. The outcome variables are binary variables; thus,
we use probit estimation and report average marginal effects in [table
8](t0008.xhtml). In these estimations, we use the following control
variables: gender, language, math grade, average grade, and whether
there are over 100 books at the student's home.[^11]

::: {role="paragraph"}
Based on the results in [table 8](t0008.xhtml), we can observe that only
in two of the savings questions (*Savings* and *Finds saving
profitable*) is the treatment effect significant. When we separate
between one and two interventions, we somewhat puzzlingly obtain a
negative treatment effect for two treatments in the *Saves regularly* as
well as *Bank account* questions but a positive effect in the *Savings*
and *Finds saving profitable* questions. In conclusion, we find no clear
effects on savings behavior.
:::

::: {role="paragraph"}
In [table 9](t0010.xhtml), we report the further treatment effect
estimates for financial behavior and attitudes. These variables are
ordinal variables. The first four variables (*Finds personal finance
easy*, *Plans the use of money*, *Impulse shopping*, *Interest in
economic issues*) take values between "1" and "5," where "1" means that
the student strongly disagrees with the statement and "5" means that the
student strongly agrees with the statement. The final variable is formed
by aggregating all five savings-related variables in [table
8](t0008.xhtml). Thus, this variable takes values between 0 and 5, where
high values indicate that the student has answered positively to more
savings questions. The results are based on an ordered probit
estimation. To save space, we report only the marginal effects for the
treatment variables. The marginal effects describe the increase in the
likelihood that students belong to a particular group.

::: {role="paragraph"}
According to [table 9](t0010.xhtml), we can observe that game-based
financial education interventions positively affect students'
self-reported interest in economic issues. This finding appears to be
related to the fact that these students start from a lower level of
interest, but they catch up by the time of the second survey. Students
who participated in one treatment also report that they plan their use
of money in the post-survey more often than those in the control group.
With respect to the other behavioral variables, we do not observe
statistically significant treatment effects.
:::

::: {role="paragraph"}
We also separately estimated the financial behavior for the three
interventions. In line with [tables 8](t0008.xhtml) and
[9](t0009.xhtml), these estimations did not reveal systematic results of
the effectiveness of the individual programs. The results are available
from the authors.

::: {role="paragraph"}
Overall, we conclude that even though game-based education interventions
improve students' financial knowledge, we find only a very weak impact
on their financial behavior and attitudes.
:::
:::

::: {#index.xhtml#sec-3-3 .section}
### False discovery rates

::: {role="paragraph"}
As previously described, we have analyzed the effects of several
different interventions on various knowledge and behavioral outcomes.
This raises concerns of multiple inferences and that some statistically
significant results may occur by chance and, thus, do not reflect real
treatment effects. To consider this possibility, we calculated the False
Discovery Rate (FDR) *q*-values following Anderson
([2008](#index.xhtml#CIT0004){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0004"}). The FDR is the proportion of rejected null
hypotheses that are false rejections (type I errors). Thus, the
*q*-values can be interpreted analogously to the standard *p*-values.
:::

::: {role="paragraph"}
For the statistically significant treatment effect estimates in [tables
6](t0006.xhtml) and [7](t0007.xhtml), the corresponding *q*-values were
less than 0.1 except for the treatment effect of a single program in
columns 6 and 8 in [table 6](t0006.xhtml) and the treatment effects of
the Oma Onni program in columns 1 and 5 in [table 7](t0007.xhtml). Thus,
our main findings that the game-based interventions have a positive
effect on financial knowledge and that two interventions appear to work
better than one remain valid after considering multiple inferences.
:::

::: {role="paragraph"}
With respect to the behavioral outcomes in [table 8](t0008.xhtml), the
*q*-values of the statistically significant treatment effects were less
than 0.1 for other outcome variables, but not for *Finds saving
profitable*. We also observed unexpected negative treatment effects when
we separated between one and two interventions in [table
8](t0008.xhtml). These negative treatment effects had *q*-values of
0.099, which could support our conclusion that these negative effects
are likely to be false discoveries. Finally, in [table 9](t0010.xhtml),
the *q*-values of the statistically significant treatment effects were
less than 0.1, except for *Impulse shopping* and *Interest in economic
issues* for participation in a single intervention.
:::
:::

::: {#index.xhtml#sec-3-4 .section}
### Robustness tests

::: {role="paragraph"}
[Table 4](t0004.xhtml) lists significant imbalances in the pretreatment
covariates between the treatment and control groups, which can
compromise the parallel trends assumption. We controlled for these
observable differences in our baseline estimations, and we now conduct
further robustness checks.
:::

::: {role="paragraph"}
First, we estimated the treatment effect by applying propensity score
(PS) matching and difference-in-differences estimation. The first step
was to calculate the probability of treatment using probit estimation
(results available from the authors). We estimated the probability
conditioning on gender, language, math grade, average grade, and whether
the teaching had started. The choice of variables was based on the
observed differences in [table 5](t0005.xhtml). All variables are
statistically significant in the probit estimation, except for math and
average grade, which are individually insignificant but jointly
significant. We do not include other variables in the probit estimation
because including additional but statistically not significant
regressors may lead to high variance and problems with the common
support condition (Caliendo and Kopeinig
[2008](#index.xhtml#CIT0007){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0007"}). The matching reduces the differences in the
covariates, and the remaining differences are statistically
insignificant.
:::

::: {role="paragraph"}
After the estimation of the PS, we estimated the average treatment
effect on the applicable students using difference-in-differences
estimation and kernel matching. The results are presented in [table
10](t0011.xhtml). The PS matching results show that the treatment effect
on financial knowledge is approximately 0.3 standard deviation. The
estimate is statistically significant but slightly lower than the
estimates in [table 5](t0005.xhtml), where the estimates are in the
range of 0.35 to 0.42. Further tests, which used coarsened exact
matching on the same set of variables, again confirmed the main results.
We also studied the effects on behavioral outcomes using the matching
methods previously described. (These results are available from the
authors.) PS matching showed statistically significant effects on the
following outcomes: *Savings*, *Finds personal finance easy*, and
*Interest in economic issues*. The first and third results are in line
with [tables 8](t0008.xhtml) and [9](t0009.xhtml), but the second result
is new.

::: {role="paragraph"}
The validity of the parallel trends assumption also could be compromised
if teaching in the control group and treatment group differed in other
respects outside of the game-based interventions. We also asked teachers
about the number of hours used for teaching and whether any other games
were used to see whether the treatment and control groups differed. The
use of other games was more common in the control group. Furthermore,
control group teachers used slightly more hours to teach economics.
Thus, we included these variables and their interaction with *Post* in
the difference-in-differences estimations. However, these variables were
not statistically significant and did not influence the main coefficient
of interest (results available from authors). It is worth noting that
the other games that the teachers mention are short games that take only
a fraction of study lessons to play. Thus, it is plausible that their
effect would be small.
:::

::: {role="paragraph"}
Another difference between the students is their mother tongue, and
thus, the study material they use in class. As [table 5](t0005.xhtml)
indicates, Swedish-speaking students form a larger share of the control
group than the treatment group. In the PS matching above, we matched the
students based on language as well as other characteristics.
Furthermore, we re-estimated [table 6](t0006.xhtml) without the
Swedish-speaking students. There was very little change in the treatment
effect estimates.
:::

::: {role="paragraph"}
Finally, there is attrition in our sample because all students did not
answer the post-survey. We accounted for this, using inverse probability
weighting in our regressions. As a further analysis of the implications
of this attrition, we conducted unweighted regressions and constructed
bounds on the treatment effects on financial knowledge following
Drexler, Fischer, and Schoar ([2014](#index.xhtml#CIT0011){.biblioref
role="doc-biblioref" xml-rid="CIT0011"}). While some of the treatment
effects in [tables 6](t0006.xhtml) and [7](t0007.xhtml) are sensitive to
the assumptions about the attrition process, this is not the case when
the full list of control variables is included or when we analyze the
effects of participation in two interventions or in Yrityskylä
program.[^12]

## Conclusions

::: {role="paragraph"}
In this article, we studied the impact of game-based interventions in
teaching economics relative to the impact of traditional teaching
methods in Finnish lower-secondary schools. Our findings indicate that
learning outcomes are better with game-based interventions when the
relevant measure is economic knowledge. This applies both to personal
finance questions as well as to more macro- and firm-oriented questions.
There is also some evidence that game-based interventions positively
impact the interest of students in economic issues.
:::

::: {role="paragraph"}
However, the impacts on (self-reported) behaviors are weak.
Methodologically, the challenge is that student behaviors are hard to
measure for under-aged students who do not make important economic
decisions independently. Future studies could investigate how
interventions could influence behavioral outcomes within game-based
simulations.
:::

::: {role="paragraph"}
The study took place in the context of Finnish 15-year-old students. The
academic performance for this group has been found to be relatively high
compared with other countries, such as the United States. The recent
OECD ([2020](#index.xhtml#CIT0031){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0031"}) study showed this comparison also to be true for
financial literacy. The question arises as to what extent the results
can be generalized to other settings. However, the external validity
problem of the samples drawn from certain contexts is almost always
present in empirical work. Although most published studies on economic
education have been conducted in the United States, studying a European
country may provide further validity to the research on economic
education. Additionally, the specific elements in economic games in the
Finnish context that would question the generalizability of the results
are not clear. The game-based approaches described in this article have
their counterparts in other countries as well, including the United
States.
:::

::: {role="paragraph"}
While similar results have been obtained in prior literature, a novelty
of our findings is that instead of focusing on a situation where there
is a games intervention vs. an absence of intervention, these findings
relate to comparisons between two different types of teaching
approaches. The findings strongly support pedagogical innovations in the
field of personal finance and economics. The use of game-based learning
approaches, which are a subset of active learning approaches, shows
promise in simultaneously making studying economics more practical and
fun. The strongest learning effects appear to be related to a game that
students play in teams and that has diverse learning objectives,
including interpersonal and communication skills. This game can also be
related to content other than just personal finance. An interesting
question for future studies of the use of games in financial education
is to see whether direct approaches work best or whether learning is
enhanced by only tangentially participating in games that relate to
financial literacy. The direct approach is taken by many available
mobile games, while there are examples of indirect approaches as well,
e.g., economics applications in blockbuster games such as Minecraft or
The Sims.
